"simpleTeleop" program has been rewritten to be as bare bone as possible.
Teleop does not lag anymore because "getJoystickSettings(joystick);" has been put in place at the beginning of every iterature of the loop.

"ForwardIRBridge" has been tested many times and works consistently (provided lined up correctly).
"WaitForwardIRBridge" has been tested a few times and works just like the one without the wait.
